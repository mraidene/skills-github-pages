Hi! I'm Mark Egbert, a 2025 Master of Financial Mathematics candidate at the University of Chicago. While I'm new to the finance industry, my undergraduate studies in Applied and Computational Mathematical Sciences and Aerospace Engineering at the University of Washington Seattle have prepared me well to pursue a career as a quant. With a passion for mathematics, programming, and engineering, I look forward to learning all that quantitative finance has to offer.
